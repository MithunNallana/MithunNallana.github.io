After reading the perfectly summarized blog post [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) and introspection, I am starting this blog with long term goal of learning in public. I will start with an aim of posting one blog article per month. See you in April-24.

This website is inspired from [Gregory Gundersen](https://gregorygundersen.com/) and [Utterences](https://utteranc.es/) for comments.
